# Project 62B

This is my passion project - a metroidvania/existential horror.

Hopefully things go according to plan lol.

## Current Features

 - A player that can move around
 - A way to load maps from tiled
 - that's about it lol

## Roadmap

 - Collision
 - Switch from tiled to LDtk (makes a lot of things easier)
 - Enemies (of course)
 - Lore + dialog system
 - Better art lol
